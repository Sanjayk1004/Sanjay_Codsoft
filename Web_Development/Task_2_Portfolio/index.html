            <h3>Lpg Gas Detection</h3>
            <p>The main purpose of this project
                is to design a microcontroller-based LPG leakage detection
                system. The system uses a MQ-6 gas sensor to find LPG leaks and
                notifies the user of the leakage using a buzzer.</p>

            <h3>Vehicle Detection and Counting</h3>
            <p>The main focus in this project is on detecting of vehicle and counting, particularly in
                traffic control. Vehicle detecting and also counting are becomes growing important
                in a area of highway regulators. However, because of the various structure of
                vehicles, their detections remain challenging which directly influence in accuracy of
                a vehicle count.

            <h3>Electricity Billing System</h3>
            <p>The proposed electricity billing system aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for both the admin and users. 
                In this system, the admin will be able to add customer data, while users can conveniently view their bills. 
                The system will allow users to register their accounts, providing necessary personal information such as name, address, and contact details.
                This idea is implemented by using frontend as Reactjs and backend as SpringBoot.

            <h3>Contact Manager</h3>
            <p>A Contact Manager project using ReactJS is a web application that allows users to manage and organize their contacts.
                 This project typically involves creating a user interface where users can perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing contacts. 
                ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it works well for creating dynamic and responsive single-page applications.
